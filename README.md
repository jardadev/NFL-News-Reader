## Project Overview

In this project, I combine various technologies to create a web application that scrapes and displays articles on NFL teams. The backend Python script uses Beautiful Soup to scrape data from Bleacher Report, while the frontend is built with Next.js and styled using TailwindCSS. The data is stored and managed in a Supabase database, and the Supabase client is used to interact with the database on the frontend.

## Features

-   **Scraping**: The Python backend script scrapes information about NFL teams, including images, titles, and summaries, from Bleacher Report.

-   **Database Storage**: The scraped data is saved to a Supabase database for efficient retrieval and management.

-   **Next.js**: The frontend is built using Next.js, a React framework that provides server-side rendering for fast and efficient performance.

-   **TailwindCSS Styling**: TailwindCSS is used to style the frontend, making it easy to create a clean and visually appealing interface.

-   **Mobile-First Design**: The application is designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience on various devices.

-   **Supabase Client**: The Supabase client is integrated into the frontend to interact with the database and fetch the scraped NFL team data.
